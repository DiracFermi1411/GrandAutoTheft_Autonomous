Each task must be completed within a 2-minute
timeframe, with the robot operating continuously without
reprogramming. The use of sensors, a web interface, or
on/off switches is allowed to indicate the specific task.
The robot must autonomously perform specific tasks. This
includes autonomously following a wall, transmitting its
X-Y location via UDP broadcast using the Vive system,
and autonomously identifying, approaching, and manipulating
either a trophy or a fake object randomly placed
on the field. Furthermore, the robot should autonomously
move to a randomly positioned police car box and push
it so that the center of the car moves at least 10 inches.
Additionally, the robot must transmit an ESP-NOW
packet each time it receives communication. In summary,
the robotâ€™s capabilities are assessed in tasks ranging from
controlled mobility and communication to autonomous
navigation, object manipulation, and interaction with
external systems.
